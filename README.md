# Sea Level Predictor

This is the boilerplate for the Sea Level Predictor project. The files have been downloaded form Replit site which was given to me to be worked on by FreeCodeCamp. I wrote my code in the 'sea_level_predictor.py'. code must be executed from 'main.py'. other than that i don't know whats the use of the other files.
